# nxcmdr

CLI utility to run applications using an env file or env variables fetched from Bitwarden

Disclaimer:
The project is currently a mix of Python and Rust due to my limited experience with Rust process management.
I will convert this to full Rust when I've attained a greater proficiency in Rust. Stay tuned!
